To access a server using SSH without a password on a Mac terminal, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Terminal app on your Mac.

2. Generate an SSH key pair if you don't already have one by typing the following command:<br />ssh-keygen -t rsa<br />You will be prompted to enter a passphrase. You can leave this blank if you want to log in without a password.

3. Once the key pair is generated, you need to copy the public key to the server you want to access. You can do this using the following command: <br />ssh-copy-id username@server_address<br />Replace "username" with your username on the server, and "server_address" with the IP address or domain name of the server.<br />You will be prompted to enter the password for the server. After entering the password, the public key will be added to the authorized_keys file on the server.

4. Now you can log in to the server using SSH without a password by typing the following command:<br />ssh username@server_address<br />You should be able to log in without being prompted for a password.
